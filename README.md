## Abstract

### EKG

Electrocardiography is a very common and non-invasive diagnostic procedure that consists in recording the electrical activity of the heart recorded through the use of electrodes and whose interpretation is increasingly supported by algorithms.
Progress in the field of automated ECG analysis has so far been hampered by the lack of adequate data sets for network training, as well as the lack of precise and adequate evaluation procedures to ensure the similarity of different algorithms.
Standard ECGs consist of 12 derivations interpreted as axes by which each ECG records the electrical potentials of the atria and ventricles of the heart. In this type of ECG, four electrodes are placed on the patientâ€™s limbs and six on the surface of the thorax, and therefore the total electrical potential of the heart is measured in twelve differences between points, commonly called "derivations"and recorded for a period of time established a priori, usually equal to ten seconds. Therefore, two fundamental processes take the name of depolarization and repolarization, and respectively indicate the process by which a heart cell changes its electrical state from a negative to a positive resting potential, and the opposite process, that is, after a cell has depolarized, must return to its negative resting state to be ready for another electrical impulse. In this way, the overall amplitude and direction of electrical depolarization of the heart are captured at all times and throughout the cardiac cycle. At the end of the repolarization, instead, there is a period of electrical inactivity whereby the ECG trace remains isoelectric until the next electrical impulse takes origin. So the correct interpretation of the ECG is possible with a 12-lead track of excellent quality and it is advisable to follow a systematic approach that allows you to proceed according to a predetermined order.
Electrocardiography also allows the detection of many heart conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, abnormalities of an atrium or a cardiac ventricle, coronary heart disease... but also to continuously monitor cardiac patients by recording the electrical activity of the heart over a whole day and allowing a detailed assessment of changes in heart rhythm and the detection of events such as breaks, tachycardia or bradycardia.
