## Abstract

### EKG

Electrocardiography is a very common and non-invasive diagnostic procedure that consists in recording the electrical activity of the heart recorded through the use of electrodes and whose interpretation is increasingly supported by algorithms.
Progress in the field of automated ECG analysis has so far been hampered by the lack of adequate data sets for network training, as well as the lack of precise and adequate evaluation procedures to ensure the similarity of different algorithms.
Standard ECGs consist of 12 derivations interpreted as axes by which each ECG records the electrical potentials of the atria and ventricles of the heart. In this type of ECG, four electrodes are placed on the patient’s limbs and six on the surface of the thorax, and therefore the total electrical potential of the heart is measured in twelve differences between points, commonly called "derivations"and recorded for a period of time established a priori, usually equal to ten seconds. Therefore, two fundamental processes take the name of depolarization and repolarization, and respectively indicate the process by which a heart cell changes its electrical state from a negative to a positive resting potential, and the opposite process, that is, after a cell has depolarized, must return to its negative resting state to be ready for another electrical impulse. In this way, the overall amplitude and direction of electrical depolarization of the heart are captured at all times and throughout the cardiac cycle. At the end of the repolarization, instead, there is a period of electrical inactivity whereby the ECG trace remains isoelectric until the next electrical impulse takes origin. So the correct interpretation of the ECG is possible with a 12-lead track of excellent quality and it is advisable to follow a systematic approach that allows you to proceed according to a predetermined order.
Electrocardiography also allows the detection of many heart conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, abnormalities of an atrium or a cardiac ventricle, coronary heart disease... but also to continuously monitor cardiac patients by recording the electrical activity of the heart over a whole day and allowing a detailed assessment of changes in heart rhythm and the detection of events such as breaks, tachycardia or bradycardia.

### Vectorcardiographic Lead Systems

Frank’s signals represent an electrocardiographic acquisition methodology that provides detailed information on the spatial distribution of the heart’s electrical activity. The acquisition of Frank’s signals is non-invasive and can be done relatively simply by using a set of electrodes placed on the patient’s chest surface to cover different regions of the heart. Unlike standard 12-lead ECGs, Frank’s signals provide a more complete map of cardiac electrical activity. This allows a different assessment of the morphology of electrical impulses, as well as abnormalities and heart disorders.
During the research, Frank’s signals were implemented due to their important correlation with three-dimensional X leads, Y and Z. Since they play a significant role in the analysis of cardiac electrical activity and because they provide a spatial representation of the heart’s electrical activity, Frank’s signals can be associated with the signals recorded by leads X, Y and Z provide a three-dimensional view of electrical activity. This correlation provides detailed information on the morphology of electrical impulses and the distribution of electrical activity in the heart.
Given the high spatial correlation between electrical activities measured in close positions, a linear transformation can be used that, starting with the 12-lead ECG, estimates the ECG with Frank’s derivations. Therefore, it was first necessary to obtain the weights of the Dower inverse matrix, in such a way as to subsequently calculate the weighted signal with respect to the weights themselves, obtained through a matrix multiplication between the two two-dimensional vectors.
