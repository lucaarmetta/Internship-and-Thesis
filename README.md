## Abstract

### EKG

Electrocardiography is a very common and non-invasive diagnostic procedure that consists in recording the electrical activity of the heart recorded through the use of electrodes and whose interpretation is increasingly supported by algorithms.\
Progress in the field of automated ECG analysis has so far been hampered by the lack of adequate data sets for network training, as well as the lack of precise and adequate evaluation procedures to ensure the similarity of different algorithms.\
Standard ECGs consist of 12 derivations interpreted as axes by which each ECG records the electrical potentials of the atria and ventricles of the heart. In this type of ECG, four electrodes are placed on the patient’s limbs and six on the surface of the thorax, and therefore the total electrical potential of the heart is measured in twelve differences between points, commonly called "derivations"and recorded for a period of time established a priori, usually equal to ten seconds. Therefore, two fundamental processes take the name of depolarization and repolarization, and respectively indicate the process by which a heart cell changes its electrical state from a negative to a positive resting potential, and the opposite process, that is, after a cell has depolarized, must return to its negative resting state to be ready for another electrical impulse. In this way, the overall amplitude and direction of electrical depolarization of the heart are captured at all times and throughout the cardiac cycle. At the end of the repolarization, instead, there is a period of electrical inactivity whereby the ECG trace remains isoelectric until the next electrical impulse takes origin. So the correct interpretation of the ECG is possible with a 12-lead track of excellent quality and it is advisable to follow a systematic approach that allows you to proceed according to a predetermined order.\
Electrocardiography also allows the detection of many heart conditions, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarctions, abnormalities of an atrium or a cardiac ventricle, coronary heart disease... but also to continuously monitor cardiac patients by recording the electrical activity of the heart over a whole day and allowing a detailed assessment of changes in heart rhythm and the detection of events such as breaks, tachycardia or bradycardia.

### Vectorcardiographic Lead Systems

Frank’s signals represent an electrocardiographic acquisition methodology that provides detailed information on the spatial distribution of the heart’s electrical activity. The acquisition of Frank’s signals is non-invasive and can be done relatively simply by using a set of electrodes placed on the patient’s chest surface to cover different regions of the heart. Unlike standard 12-lead ECGs, Frank’s signals provide a more complete map of cardiac electrical activity. This allows a different assessment of the morphology of electrical impulses, as well as abnormalities and heart disorders.\
During the research, Frank’s signals were implemented due to their important correlation with three-dimensional X leads, Y and Z. Since they play a significant role in the analysis of cardiac electrical activity and because they provide a spatial representation of the heart’s electrical activity, Frank’s signals can be associated with the signals recorded by leads X, Y and Z provide a three-dimensional view of electrical activity. This correlation provides detailed information on the morphology of electrical impulses and the distribution of electrical activity in the heart.\
Given the high spatial correlation between electrical activities measured in close positions, a linear transformation can be used that, starting with the 12-lead ECG, estimates the ECG with Frank’s derivations. Therefore, it was first necessary to obtain the weights of the Dower inverse matrix, in such a way as to subsequently calculate the weighted signal with respect to the weights themselves, obtained through a matrix multiplication between the two two-dimensional vectors.

### Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning

The field of ECG analysis has undergone a significant transformation thanks to the application of deep learning techniques. These advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies have been shown to be extremely promising in improving accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis and classification of heart conditions.\
In particular convolutional neural networks, due to their ability to automatically learn relevant characteristics from the data, have proven specifically suitable for the classification of cardiac arrhythmias. They are able to capture complex patterns and identify signals of interest, allowing doctors to achieve more accurate and timely results in the diagnosis of heart disease. Recurrent neural networks, on the other hand, are able to model the temporal dependencies present in ECGs and are used for tasks such as the detection of abnormalities and the prediction of cardiac events.\
A key aspect in applying deep learning to ECG analysis is the availability of large, high-quality training datasets. These datasets contain thousands of expert-annotated ECG records, allowing neural networks to learn from previous cases and generate accurate predictions about new data. However, the collection and annotation of these datasets still represent a significant challenge that requires considerable human effort and collaboration between physicians and researchers.\
The application of deep learning to ECG analysis offers many opportunities, but also presents some challenges. The robustness of the network to signal changes, the explicability of the decisions made by the network itself and the need for customization to adapt to different clinical contexts are just some of the issues to consider. Furthermore, the integration of deep learning technologies into clinical practice requires a careful assessment of risks, safety and ethics.\
One of the main challenges in applying deep learning to ECGs is the scarcity of labeled data available. Accurate data labeling requires the expertise of medical experts to identify and annotate heart abnormalities. This process can be costly and can take a long time. As a result, a limited number of labelled data is often available, which can affect the ability of neural networks to generalize and achieve accurate results. Because ECG can vary greatly between patients, even in the presence of the same heart condition, variability may be due to numerous factors such as age, gender, electrode position, and individual physiological conditions. This variability represents a challenge for neural networks as they must be able to recognize and adapt to these individual differences in order to achieve accurate and reliable results.\
However, before you can apply analysis algorithms and AI models, you need to do a proper ECG pre-processing. Pre-processing plays a crucial role in improving signal quality, eliminating unwanted noise and preparing data for proper analysis. ECGs are often affected by noise, such as electrical interference or muscle movements, which can compromise the accuracy of subsequent analysis. ECG pre-processing involves the application of filtering techniques to remove unwanted noise and isolate the pure heart signal. This allows a cleaner representation of the signal and facilitates the identification of significant patterns and anomalies.\
Despite these challenges, the results achieved so far are extremely promising: the combination of medical skills and deep learning knowledge is opening up new perspectives in ECG analysis, allowing more accurate diagnosis, timely and personalized for patients with heart disease. The use of deep learning in ECG analysis is a rapidly evolving field of research and will certainly continue to make significant contributions to cardiological clinical practice.\
To conclude, the potential of deep learning in ECG analysis is enormous: The set of advanced AI models and medical doctors' clinical experience provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve the diagnosis, prognosis and management of heart disease. Ongoing research and collaboration between doctors and researchers will be key to fully harnessing the potential of these technologies and bringing tangible benefits to heart disease patients.

### Research Goal

The aim of the research was to reconstruct, from an electrocardiogram (ECG), the signal that would ideally precede and follow over time. This required the preliminary analysis of the ECGs examined, in order to subsequently define and train the convolutional neural network (CNN) through the use of deep learning to ensure that you could predict the evolution of the ECG itself.\
Since clinics still use a lot of paper ECG’s that have a duration of ten seconds, of which the first five show the first 6 leads of the ECG while the remaining five show the remaining 6 leads of the ECG, the goal was to reconstruct the leads that are not observed, namely the first 6 in the second five seconds, and the second 6 in the first five seconds, starting from the initial information held.
